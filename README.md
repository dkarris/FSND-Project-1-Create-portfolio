##FSND-Project-1-Create-portfolio

Responsive portfolio website built for Udacity FSND Project 1.

Key features:

* Built using using Bootstap framework
* Changing layout based on viewport width
* Images optimized based on the viewport
* Menu built using Bootstrap collapsing at 768px width to hamburger icon
* Sample modals loaded by clicking on logo or navbar buttons
* Images used from pixabay.com - public domain images

###Still need to fix:

PageOptimization showing only 56/100 for mobile devices - main drawbacks: using Bootstrap and ajax scripts which decrease loading time. At present I don't have knowledge to implement changing this JS script. Hopefully, as I'll finish other projects and take JS class, this will get fixed.

Update: for whatever reason github html previewer doesn't show svg logo, though running live from local host and remote server is fine.
